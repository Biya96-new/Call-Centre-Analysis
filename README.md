This project was carried out for a Telecom Industry to analyze customer and agent behavior by visualizing key performance metrics 
such as the total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, call duration, and overall customer satisfaction. 
The primary goal was to gain insights into call center operations and improve decision-making based on data.

**Key metrics visualized in the report include:**

Total Number of Calls Answered: Breakdown of how many calls were successfully answered by agents.

Calls Abandoned: Insights into the number of calls that customers abandoned before being answered.

Speed of Answer: Analysis of how quickly calls were answered by agents.

Length of Call: Average and distribution of call lengths to measure agent efficiency.

Customer Satisfaction: Feedback metrics that assess customer satisfaction after interactions.

**Key insights that can be gleaned from the data:**

Overall Performance: It appears that Martha is the top-performing agent based on customer rating (3.47). Call center performance peaked between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM weekdays. Contract renewals and streaming service inquiries were the most common call types.

Areas for Improvement: While overall customer service ratings are positive, there is room for improvement in several areas. For instance, Greg and Becky have the lowest customer ratings (3.33 and 3.37 respectively). Additionally, the average speed of answer could be improved across the board.
