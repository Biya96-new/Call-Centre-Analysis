This project was carried out for a Telecom Industry to analyze customer and agent behavior by visualizing key performance metrics 
such as the total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, call duration, and overall customer satisfaction. 
The primary goal was to gain insights into call center operations and improve decision-making based on data.

**Key metrics visualized in the report include:**

**Overall Performance**

Peak Performance: Call center performance peaked between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM on weekdays, indicating that this time frame may be optimal for staffing and resource allocation.

Top Agent: Martha is the top-performing agent based on customer rating (3.47), suggesting that her approach to customer service is highly effective.

**Call Volume and Resolution**

Most Common Calls: Contract renewals and streaming service inquiries were the most common call types, indicating a need for targeted training and support for these areas.

Issue Resolution: While the overall issue resolution rate is not explicitly provided, the data suggests that agents are generally effective in resolving customer issues, as the average time spent per call is relatively low.
Customer Satisfaction

Positive Ratings: Overall, customer satisfaction is positive, as evidenced by the average customer rating of 3.40.

Areas for Improvement: While the majority of agents have positive ratings, Greg and Becky have lower ratings (3.33 and 3.37, respectively), indicating potential areas for improvement in their customer service skills or approaches.

**Agent Performance**

Speed of Answer: The average speed of answer could be improved across the board, as there is some variation in the time it takes agents to respond to incoming calls.

Talk Duration: The average talk duration is relatively low, suggesting that agents are efficient in their interactions with customers.

In conclusion, while the overall performance of the call center is positive, there are opportunities for improvement in certain areas, particularly in terms of agent training, customer satisfaction, and call handling efficiency.

Areas for Improvement: While overall customer service ratings are positive, there is room for improvement in several areas. For instance, Greg and Becky have the lowest customer ratings (3.33 and 3.37 respectively). Additionally, the average speed of answer could be improved across the board.
